#### Description:
    This is a basic Hotel Reservation System design using OOP. This project is flexible for as many room as possible. And it support 3 types of rooms that are Standard, Deluxe, and Executive.

    1. In this project we can add as many customer as possible, it will save them. And assign each customer with a unique ID that is generated using there first letter of first name, last name, and last 4 letter of phone number.
    2. Each room can be book once. For this each room have its own calender that can be set accordingly for almost 3 to 4 months ahead. The purpose of this is also to ensure that the room doesn't appear if another customer want to reserve a room at the same date.
    3. Reservation can be also modified and cancelled by the customer if they wanna change.
    4. After reservation, modification, and cancellation a bill is generated that is updated with each task that is mention above.
    5. The program also show the available rooms during reservation and modification along with availability dates.
#### Constraints:
    The program is design only for one hotel and for 3 types of rooms only. Besides that it is only for Reserving rooms not a complete management system that have managing employee capability.
